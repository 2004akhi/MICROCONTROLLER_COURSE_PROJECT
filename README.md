# AIM
The aim of this project is to design and implement
an autonomous line following robot using an 8051
microcontroller. The robot will be capable of
detecting and tracking a line often a white surface.
These robots are widely used in various
applications, from industrial automation to
educational programming.
## KEY COMPONENTS
• Breadboard
• 8051 Microcontroller (AT89C51)
• 10 kΩ Resistors
• 10 μF Capacitor
• 33 pF Capacitor
• Push Button
• 11.0592 MHz Crystal
• Motor driver Module(L293D)
• IR Sensors
• DC Motors
## Conclusion
One of the key takeaways from this project is the
importance of interdisciplinary collaboration.
Combining knowledge from electronics, programming,
and robotics, we were able to integrate sensors, resulting
in a robust and reliable robot.
